## How It Was Built

### Development Journey

This project was built following a **real-world development workflow** with feature-by-feature commits:

1. **Project Scaffolding** - Set up Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
2. **Core Components** - Built layout, header, and navigation
3. **PDF Integration** - Implemented upload and viewer functionality
4. **AI Integration** - Connected Google Gemini API for quiz generation
5. **Quiz System** - Developed quiz generator, display, and scoring logic
6. **Progress Tracking** - Added localStorage and dashboard analytics
7. **Chat Feature** - Built interactive AI chat interface
8. **Theming** - Applied dark theme with OKLCH colors and gradients
9. **Error Handling** - Added error boundaries and skeleton loaders
10. **Accessibility** - Ensured WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
11. **Mobile Optimization** - Fixed responsive issues across all pages

### Key Technical Decisions

**Next.js App Router**: Chosen for modern React patterns, built-in optimizations, and better developer experience.

**Google Gemini AI**: Selected for its generous free tier, fast response times, and good performance on educational content.

**shadcn/ui**: Used for accessible, customizable components built on Radix UI primitives, ensuring WCAG compliance out of the box.

**OKLCH Color Space**: Implemented for perceptually uniform colors and better dark mode aesthetics.

**Client-Side Storage**: Used localStorage instead of a database to keep the project simple and deployable without backend infrastructure.

**Dynamic Imports**: Employed for PDF viewer to avoid SSR issues with browser-only APIs.

## What's Implemented

- PDF upload with drag-and-drop
- PDF viewer with zoom and pagination
- AI quiz generation (MCQ, SAQ, LAQ)
- Quiz scoring with explanations
- Progress tracking dashboard
- Quiz history with timestamps
- AI chat interface
- Dark theme with modern UI
- Full mobile responsiveness
- WCAG accessibility compliance
- Error boundaries
- Loading states with skeletons
- Conventional commit messages
- Clean, maintainable code

## Known Limitations

- **No Backend Database**: Quiz history is stored in localStorage, so data is device-specific
- **SAQ/LAQ Scoring**: Only MCQs have automatic scoring; SAQ/LAQ show model answers for self-evaluation
- **PDF Size**: Very large PDFs (100+ pages) may cause slower processing times
- **API Rate Limits**: Google Gemini free tier has rate limits that may affect heavy usage

## LLM Usage

This project was built **with significant assistance from Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant)**. Here's how LLMs were used:

### Code Generation
- Claude generated approximately **80-90% of the initial code** for components, API routes, and utilities
- All React components were scaffolded with AI assistance
- Gemini AI integration code was written with Claude's help

### Problem Solving
- **SSR Issues**: Claude helped resolve `DOMMatrix is not defined` error by suggesting dynamic imports
- **JSON Parsing**: Fixed Gemini API response parsing issues with improved regex patterns
- **Theme Implementation**: Designed and implemented the dark theme color system
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Fixed overflow and layout issues on mobile devices

### Code Quality
- TypeScript types and interfaces were refined with AI assistance
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, semantic HTML) were added based on AI recommendations
- Code organization and file structure were improved through AI suggestions

### Documentation
- This README was drafted with Claude's help
- Git commit messages follow conventional commits pattern suggested by AI
- Code comments and documentation were enhanced with AI assistance

### Human Contributions
- **Project Architecture**: Final decisions on tech stack and architecture
- **UI/UX Design**: Design choices, color schemes, and user flows
- **Testing**: Manual testing and bug fixes
- **Git Workflow**: Commit strategy and version control
- **Deployment**: Deployment configuration and environment setup
